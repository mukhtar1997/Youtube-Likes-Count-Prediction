# Youtube-Likes-Count-Prediction

Summary:

I am excited to share my latest project, "YouTube Likes Count Prediction,
" where I leveraged a Linear Regression Model to predict the number of likes a YouTube video might receive. 
This project aims to assist content creators and marketers in understanding the potential impact of their videos.

Key Features:

Utilized a Linear Regression algorithm for predicting likes based on various features.
Gathered and preprocessed data from YouTube videos, including views, comments, and duration.
Explored correlations and feature importance to enhance model accuracy.
Implemented the model using Python and popular data Analytics libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
Evaluated the model's performance through metrics like Mean Squared Error and R-squared.

Outcome:
The predictive model provides valuable insights into factors influencing YouTube likes, 
empowering content creators to optimize their video content and engagement strategies.
